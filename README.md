# DrumPy
 My Final porject for Applied OO

Currently doesn't work on windows properly. This was originally coded to use Ubuntu on Raspebrry Pi. Should be easy fix.
The current issues:
    -Cannot run 32 bit .wav files (I fixed this on the pi by downloading an older version of pygame)

Uses keyboard input from user to play pre recorded drum samples

a - kick
s -snare
t - closed hihat
y - open hat
u - ride cymbal
g - crash cymbal
f - floor tom

drum kit is a separate module that contains and loads all of the sounds
